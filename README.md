# Password-Generator

##Description

The purpose of this project was to make our client a password generator that would randomly generate a password based on criteria selected by the user. This project was made in order to create strong passwords for better security.

During this project I learned: how and when to call javascript variables and functions, if statements, for loops, accessing and manipulating global object properties using Javascript, how to randomly select a number, and the use of eventlistener.

##Usage

When the generate password button is clicked, the user will be  presented with 5 prompts: length of the password that will be generated, whether to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. After at least one of the prompts are selected, a randomly generated string of characters matching the criteria that the user selected. There is no istallation required.
